    "Szyfr Cezara – jedna z najprostszych technik szyfrowania. Jest to rodzaj szyfru podstawieniowego, w którym każda litera tekstu jawnego (niezaszyfrowanego) zastępowana jest inną, oddaloną od niej o stałą liczbę pozycji w alfabecie, literą (szyfr monoalfabetyczny), przy czym kierunek zamiany musi być zachowany. Nie rozróżnia się przy tym liter dużych i małych. \n",

      "Okay, so the user has this problem where they have 10 sentences encoded with the Caesar cipher, each possibly with a different shift.

      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand what the Caesar cipher is. It's a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on. The challenge here is that each sentence might have a different shift, so I can't just apply the same shift to all of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user wants the encoded version of the sentence, but I think they actually want it decoded since they mentioned finding the right shift. Maybe they meant decoding. I'll proceed under that assumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the provided sentence, I notice that the words don't make sense in English. That suggests it's encoded. Since Caesar ciphers usually have a shift between 1 and 25, I can try to figure out the shift by looking for common patterns or words.\n",
      "\n",
      "One approach is frequency analysis. In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, etc. If I look at the encoded sentence, the most frequent letters might correspond to these. Alternatively, I can look for common bigrams or trigrams, like \"th\" or \"ing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another method is to try possible shifts and see if any of them result in a readable sentence. Since there are only 25 possible shifts, it's manageable, though time-consuming. I can start by trying a shift of 1 and see if any words become recognizable.\n",

      "Let's take the first few words: \"Uif qmbdfcp fggfdu jt...\" If I shift each letter back by 1, \"U\" becomes \"T\", \"i\" becomes \"h\", \"f\" becomes \"e\", so \"Uif\" becomes \"The\". That looks promising. Let's check the next word: \"qmbdfcp\" shifted back by 1 becomes \"pemaleco\". Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try again. \"q\" becomes \"p\", \"m\" becomes \"l\", \"b\" becomes \"a\", \"d\" becomes \"c\", \"f\" becomes \"e\", \"c\" becomes \"b\", \"p\" becomes \"o\". So \"qmbdfcp\" becomes \"please\". Oh, that makes sense! So the shift is likely 1 because \"Uif\" becomes \"The\" and \"qmbdfcp\" becomes \"please\".\n",

      "Let me check the next word: \"fggfdu\" shifted back by 1 becomes \"eegect\". Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I did something wrong. Let me try shifting \"fggfdu\" by 1: \"f\"→\"e\", \"g\"→\"f\", another \"g\"→\"f\", \"f\"→\"e\", \"d\"→\"c\", \"u\"→\"t\". So it becomes \"effe ct\". That doesn't look right. Maybe I need to double-check.\n",

So \"fggfdu\" becomes \"effe ct\". Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Maybe the shift isn't 1? But the first word worked. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different shift for this particular sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think I might have confused the direction. Maybe it's shifted forward by 1 instead of backward. Let me try that. If the original is shifted by +1, then decoding would require shifting back by 1. But if I shift \"fggfdu\" forward by 1, it becomes \"gggh ev\". That doesn't help. Wait, no, if the encoded text is shifted by +1, then to decode, I shift back by 1, which I did. So \"fggfdu\" becomes \"effe ct\", which doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the shifting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let's take another word. \"jt\" shifted back by 1 becomes \"is\". That makes sense. So \"jt\" is \"is\". So the shift is definitely 1. Then why isn't \"fggfdu\" making sense? Let me check again. \"f\"→\"e\", \"g\"→\"f\", \"g\"→\"f\", \"f\"→\"e\", \"d\"→\"c\", \"u\"→\"t\". So it's \"effe ct\". Hmm, maybe it's \"effect\"? No, that would require \"fggfdu\" to be \"effect\", which would mean a shift of 1: e→f, f→g, f→g, e→f, c→d, t→u. Wait, but \"effect\" is 6 letters, and \"fggfdu\" is 6 letters. So \"e f f e c t\" becomes \"f g g f d u\". Yes, that makes sense. So \"fggfdu\" is \"effect\". I must have miscounted earlier.\n",

      "Alright, so the user has this problem where they have 10 sentences encoded using the Caesar cipher, each possibly with a different shift. Their goal is to decode each sentence by finding the correct shift. They provided one of the sentences: \"Vjg jwocp dtckp ku pgwtqrncuvke, yjkej ogcpu kv ecp ejcpig cpf cfcrv vjtqwijqwv nkhg kp tgurqpug vq gzrgtkgpegu.\" They want the encoded version with the proper shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, wait, actually, the user said they need the encoded version, but they provided a coded sentence. So, perhaps they meant to decode it? Because usually, you decode to get the original message. Maybe they got confused with the terms. I should clarify that, but since they specifically asked for the encoded version with the correct shift, I'll proceed accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If they have a coded sentence, applying a shift would either encode or decode it, depending on the direction. So, perhaps they meant to decode it. But the user said they have 10 coded sentences and need to encode them, which is confusing. Maybe they meant to decode each to find the right shift. I'll assume they want to decode it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Caesar cipher works by shifting each letter by a certain number down the alphabet. To decode, we need to find out the shift used. Since the shift could be different for each sentence, I'll focus on this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the sentence, it's in uppercase, so I'll work with that. The first word is \"Vjg.\" In English, common starting words are \"The\" or \"I.\" Let's test shifting \"V\" to \"T,\" which is a shift of 1 (since V is the 22nd letter, T is 20th, so 22-2=20, which is a shift of -2). Let's apply a shift of 2 to each letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "V shifted by 2 becomes T, j becomes h, g becomes e. So \"Vjg\" becomes \"The.\" That makes sense. Let's check the next word: \"jwocp.\" Shifting each letter by 2: j→h, w→t, o→m, c→a, p→n. So \"jwocp\" becomes \"hmtan.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, \"jwocp\": j→h, w→t, o→m, c→a, p→n. So \"h t m a n\"? That's \"htman,\" which isn't a word. Maybe the shift isn't 2. Let me try a different approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, looking at the word \"Vjg,\" if I shift each letter by 1, V→U, j→I, g→F. That gives \"UIF,\" which isn't as common as \"THE.\" So shift of 2 seems better, but the next word didn't make sense. Maybe I should try another word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at \"dtckp\": d→b, t→r, c→a, k→i, p→n with shift 2? Wait, no. Wait, if shift is 2, each letter is shifted back by 2. So d would be b, t would be r, c→a, k→i, p→n, so \"brain.\" Oh, that makes sense! So \"dtckp\" becomes \"brain.\" So shift of 2 is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, \"ku\" shifted by 2 becomes \"it.\" So the first part is \"The brain it.\" That fits. Next word: \"pgwtqrncuvke.\" Let's shift each letter by 2: p→n, g→e, w→t, t→r, q→o, r→p, n→l, c→a, u→s, v→t, k→i, e→c. So that would be \"netrop... Wait, let's write it out: n e t r o p l a s t i c. So \"plastic.\" Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the sentence starts with \"The brain it plastic,\" which is correct. The rest should follow. So the shift is 2. Therefore, applying a shift of 2 to the entire sentence will decode it correctly. So the encoded version would be the original with shift 2 applied, but wait, the user provided the coded sentence, so to get the original, we shift back by 2. Therefore, the encoded version with shift 2 is the original sentence, and decoding it gives us the plain text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting confused. The user wants the encoded version with the proper shift. But they provided a coded sentence. So perhaps they meant to decode it, but phrased it as encoding. Alternatively, maybe they want to encode a plain text sentence, but they provided a coded one. This is a bit confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking to decode the given sentence by finding the shift, which is 2, so the decoded message is \"The brain is plastic...\" So maybe they want the decoded version, which would be the encoded version with shift 2 applied. But I'm a bit tangled here.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, the key step is to find the shift by looking for common words. Since \"Vjg\" shifted by 2 gives \"The,\" and \"dtckp\" gives \"brain,\" and \"ku\" gives \"it,\" it's consistent. Therefore, the shift is 2, and the decoded message would be \"The brain is plastic...\" etc.\n",

      "Alright, so I've got this sentence that's been encoded using the Caesar cipher, and my task is to figure out the correct shift to decode it.

      "\n",
      "First, I need to remember how the Caesar cipher works. From what I recall, it's a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would become B, B becomes C, and so on. The challenge here is that each sentence might have a different shift, so I can't just apply the same shift to all of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I'm dealing with just one sentence right now, I can focus all my efforts on this. My goal is to find the shift that was used to encode this particular sentence. I think the best approach is to use frequency analysis because English letters have certain frequencies, and by comparing the frequencies in the ciphered text to the average frequencies in English, I can make educated guesses about the shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before diving into that, maybe I can look for some common words or patterns in the ciphered text. Sometimes, in longer texts, common words like \"the,\" \"and,\" \"that,\" etc., can be identified, which can help in determining the shift. However, looking at the sentence, I don't immediately recognize any common words, so maybe frequency analysis is the way to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me start by listing out the letters in the ciphered text and their frequencies. I'll count how many times each letter appears.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, that might take a while. Alternatively, I can note that the most frequent letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, etc. So I can look for the most frequent letters in the ciphered text and see if they correspond to any of these.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the ciphered text, I notice that the letter 'J' appears quite a few times. Let me count: J appears 14 times. That's a lot.

If that's the case, then the shift would be the number of positions from 'J' to 'E'. Let's see: J is the 10th letter (A=1), and E is the 5th. So the shift would be 10 - 5 = 5, but since in Caesar cipher, shifting can be done forward or backward. Wait, actually, in decoding, if the ciphered letter is J and it's supposed to be E, that means each letter was shifted forward by 5 places (since J is 5 places after E). But wait, no: in encoding, if you shift forward by 5, E becomes J. So to decode, we need to shift backward by 5.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Frequency Analysis:**  The most frequent letters in the ciphertext are a good starting point. In English, 'e', 't', 'a', and 'o' are the most common. Look at the frequency of letters in the ciphertext. \"m\" is the most often character in the given text, so it might stand for one of \"e\", \"t\", \"a\" or \"o\".\n",
      "2.  **Common Words/Patterns:** Look for short words or patterns that are likely to be real words after decoding.  \"bpm\" is a good can be tried as \"the\".\n",
      "3.  **Trial and Error:**  Try different shifts based on the above guesses.  If you think \"m\" = \"e\", then the shift is -8. If you think \"m\" = \"t\", then the shift is -12.  And so on.  Or, if \"bpm\"=\"the\", then shift is -1.\n",

      "\n",
      "Let's break down my strategy:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Frequency Analysis:**  Caesar ciphers rely on shifting letters.  The most common letter in English is 'E'.  I'll look for the most frequent letters in your sentence and assume they represent 'E'.  This gives me a possible shift value.  Also, 'T', 'A', 'O', 'I', 'N', 'S', 'H', and 'R' are common, so I'll consider those too.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Common Words:**  I'll look for patterns that might represent common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"is\", \"are\", \"that\", \"this\", \"with\", \"for\", etc.  If I can identify a common word, it gives me a strong clue about the shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Letter Combinations:**  Certain letter combinations are common (e.g., \"th\", \"he\", \"in\", \"er\", \"an\").  I'll look for repeating patterns that might represent these combinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Trial and Error:** I'll apply the potential shift values and see if the resulting text looks more like English. I'll start by decoding the whole sentence with shift that gave me most realistical word.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Iterate:** If the initial guess is wrong, I'll adjust the shift value and repeat the process until I get a readable sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with your provided sentence:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ynxyun jan vxan urtnuh cx knurnen rwoxavjcrxw cqjc lxworavb cqnra yanngrbcrwp knurnob.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Frequency Analysis:** The most frequent letter is 'n'. Let's assume 'n' is 'e'. This means the shift is 9 (n - e = 9).\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Therefore you decide to properly understand complex relationships between different parameters properly.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "2.  **Common Word Patterns:** Look for short, common words.  \"kxn\" (likely \"and\") is the most obvious candidate in this sentence. If we assume \"kxn\" decrypts to \"and\", we can calculate the shift.\n",
