      "**Explanation of the Decoding Process:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Caesar Cipher:** I recognized the pattern as a Caesar cipher because of the consistent letter shifts.\n",
      "*   **Trial and Error:** I started by trying different shift values (1, 2, 3, etc.) on the first sentence. A shift of -1 (shifting each letter back one place in the alphabet) worked perfectly.\n",
      "*   **Applying the Shift:** Once I found the shift for the first sentence, I applied the same shift to the remaining sentences.\n",
      "*   **Adjustments:** Some sentences required slight adjustments to the shift value to make sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Notes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Context:** The context of the text helped me confirm the correct decoding.\n",
      "*   **Word Recognition:** Recognizing common words (like \"the,\" \"and,\" \"is\") was crucial in identifying the correct shift.\n",
      "*   **Punctuation:** Punctuation remained unchanged during the decoding process.\n",

      "Okay, so I've got this encoded message that looks like some kind of cipher text. It's all uppercase letters without any spaces or punctuation, which makes me think it might be in the English alphabet but shifted somehow. Maybe it's a Caesar cipher? Or could it be something else like a substitution cipher?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me start by looking at the first few words: \"Uif qmbdfcp fggfdu jt b qifopnfopo jo xijdi qfpqmf fyqfsjfodf bo jnqspwfnfou\". Hmm, if I recall, in the Caesar cipher, each letter is shifted by a certain number down the alphabet. For example, A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on. Since these words don't make immediate sense to me, it's likely that they've been shifted by several letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should try to figure out the shift value first. Maybe I can look for common letters or patterns. Wait, in English, the most common letter is 'E', followed by 'T' and 'A'. So if I can find where these might appear in the cipher text, that could give me a clue about the shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking through the text, I see \"fyqfsjfodf\". If I isolate the last few letters: \"fodf\". Maybe \"FODF\" is an acronym or stands for something. Or perhaps it's a shifted version of another word. Let's try shifting each letter back by 3 to see if that makes sense, since sometimes shift values are modulo 26. So F (6) shifted back by 3 would be C (3). O (15) becomes K (12), D (4) becomes A (1), and F (6) becomes B (2). So \"FODF\" would become \"KAB\". Hmm, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe I need a different shift.\n",

      "Let me try shifting each letter back by 1 to see what happens. U becomes T, I becomes H, etc. Let's take the first word: Uif. Shifting each letter back by 1 gives Tdh. That still doesn't mean anything. How about shifting back by 2? U->S, i->h, f->e. So \"Uif\" becomes \"She\". Oh! That makes sense! So the shift is probably -3 because shifting back by 3 would give us S (U-3=T, I-3=H, F-3=E). Wait no, U-1= T, so maybe it's a shift of +13? Because if you shift each letter forward by 13, that's like a ROT13 cipher.\n",

F becomes S (+13 from F=6, so 19=S). So \"Uif\" becomes \"Hvs\". Hmm, that's not right. Wait, maybe I got the shift direction wrong.\n",

      "Alright, so I came across this encoded message and decided to try decoding it myself. It's something like \"Uif qmbdfcp fggfdu jt b qifopnfopo jo xijdi qfpqmf fyqfsjfodf bo jnqspwfnfou jo ifbmui bgufs ubljoh b tvctubodf xjui op nfejdjobm qspqfsujft cfdbvtf uifz cfmjfwf ju xpslt.\" At first glance, it looks like a jumble of letters. I remember that this kind of text is usually ciphered using the Caesar Cipher, which shifts each letter by a certain number in the alphabet.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my initial thought is to figure out what shift was used here. The classic Caesar Cipher uses a shift of 3 or 1, so maybe it's one of those. To test that, I'll try shifting each letter by 1 and see if it makes sense. Let's take the first word: \"Uif\". Shifting each letter back by 1 would make U into T, i into h, and f into e. So \"Tif\" doesn't seem right, but maybe \"The\"? Wait, that doesn't fit perfectly. Maybe I'm not doing it correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the shift is 3. Let's try shifting each letter back by 3. U shifted back by 3 would be X, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe the cipher isn't a simple Caesar shift then. Could it be something else, like a Vigenère cipher with a keyword? That might complicate things because I don't know the key.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach is to look for common words or patterns in the text. For example, \"jo\" could stand for \"to\", which makes sense if each letter is shifted back by 3: j becomes i, o becomes n, so \"in\". Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a shift of 1 again. J shifted back by 1 would be I, and o would become n, making \"in\". That could work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me test this with another part. The word \"fjord\" in the text might stand for something like \"there\". So f becomes e, j becomes i, o remains o (if shift is less than that), but wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try shifting each letter back by 1 throughout.\n",

A full frequency analysis would involve comparing the letter frequencies in the ciphertext to the known frequencies of letters in the English language.\n",
      "3. **Trial and Error (Targeted):** I started with a shift of -1 because it's a common starting point.  It's often the first thing I try when suspecting a Caesar cipher.\n",
      "4. **Contextual Validation:**  Once I had a potential decoding, I checked it for contextual sense. The resulting sentence, while a bit unusual in its phrasing (\"place base effect\"), was grammatically correct and made a degree of sense. This further solidified my confidence in the solution.\n",

      "* **More Complex Ciphers:** If the sentence had been more convoluted or the shift less obvious, I would have considered other substitution ciphers (e.g., Vigenère), transposition ciphers, or even more advanced techniques involving polyalphabetic substitution or combinations of different methods.\n",
      "* **Key Length (For Polyalphabetic Ciphers):**  If a Vigenère cipher was suspected, determining the key length would be crucial.  Kasiski examination and Friedman test are standard techniques for this.\n",

The shift is usually consistent throughout the message.\n",

      "\n",
      "One common method for solving Caesar Ciphers is frequency analysis. In English, certain letters like 'E', 'T', 'A', etc., appear more frequently than others. Maybe I can look at the frequency of letters in the given ciphertext to guess which one corresponds to a common letter.\n",

      "Looking at the sentence, I notice that some words repeat or have similar structures. For example, \"Vjg\" and \"yjkej\" might be short words like 'the' or 'and'. Also, commas and periods are present, so punctuation is preserved, which could help in identifying word boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach is to look for common bigrams or trigrams in English. For instance, 'th', 'he', 'in', etc., are common. If I can spot any of these patterns in the ciphertext, it might give me a clue about the shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try some trial shifts manually. Maybe start with shifting each letter by 13 places because sometimes people use ROT13 as a simple cipher, but I don't know if that's the case here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking the first word: \"Vjg\". If I shift V back by 13, V is the 22nd letter, so 22 -13 =9, which is I. J shifted back 13 is I as well (J is 10, 10-13= -3, but since we can't have negative letters, it wraps around. Alternatively, shifting forward by 13: A becomes N, B becomes O, etc., so V shifted back 13 would be I because V is the 22nd letter, and 22 +13 =35, which modulo 26 is 9, which is I again. So V -> I, J -> I, G-> T? Wait, G is 7, 7 -13= -6, which wraps around to 20 (T). So \"Vjg\" would be \"Iit\"? That doesn't seem right because 'iit' isn't a common word.\n",

    "Podsumowując, nawet używając względnie niewielkiego modelu, byliśmy w stanie rozszyfrować zdania zakodowane szyfrem Cezara. Niestety ograniczenia sprzętowe nie pozwoliły na użycie większego DeepSeek'a, który poradził sobie ze wszystkim. Napiszmy teraz funkcję, która rozszyfruje zdania na inpucie, stosując przesunięcie i szyfr zaproponowany przez nasz model."
